## **Facet Registry (Governance & Approval Layer)**

**Location:** `src/facetRegistry/`

**Key files:**

- `FacetRegistry.sol` — Manages facet registration and version tracking
- `IFacetRegistry.sol` — Public interface

---

### **What It Does**

The Facet Registry is the **governed catalog of approved facets**. It acts as a gatekeeper ensuring:

- **Only pre-approved facets** can be added to Gardens.
- **4 immutable base facets** (Ownership, Cut, Upgrade, Loupe) remain protected.
- **Complete audit trail** of all facet changes via versioning.
- **Off-chain tools** can discover which facets and functions are available.

### **Core Operations**

**1. Register facets: `upgradeFacetRegistry()`**

Called by governance to register, update, or remove facets. Validates that facets are contracts and that core base facets are never modified.

**2. Query operations:**

- `getFacets()`: Get all facets and their selectors.
- `getFacetAddress(selector)`: Find the facet for a specific function.
- `isFacetRegistered(address)`: Verify approval status.

### **Safety Mechanisms**

- **Immutable base facets**: Core Diamond logic cannot be "bricked".
- **DAO Approval Required**: Governance must vote on new facet registrations.
- **Version Tracking**: Every change creates a permanent record in history.
