    "description": "The development of the BLOK Capital Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem will be progressive and highly transparent. As all the team strongly believes in the vision of the project, we also believe that ultimately, the purpose of such a platform is to give value back to the users, whether they are high net-worth investors or small investors just starting out with crypto-based investments. For this, the BLOK Capital DeFi project is broken down into two phases, with a long-term outlook for development. Imagine a future where you donâ€™t have to depend on any financial institution to take part in various financial opportunities. BLOK Capital DeFi will be a space where users of all walks of life can avail of financial services without having to be blockchain or crypto investment experts. It will be a space that runs on the principles of full custody and freedom of your wealth along with full transparency and the highest security. Everything will be secured through a blockchain backbone, one that starts out by delivering the vision but then evolves as the technology matures, and with that, new features and security measures will be added."
