# Color Palette

At BLOK Capital, our color palette is carefully curated to reflect both our technological innovation and our community-first approach. Each color has been chosen with intentional symbolism, supporting our brand narrative and enhancing visual coherence across all platforms.

Our visual identity bridges the world of blockchain with the elegance of being easier, safer, and smarter. The use of colors in our illustrations, UI elements, and overall website design aims to express this balance, creating an environment that feels secure, vibrant, and forward-thinking.

## The Palette

Our color palette is built to resonate with our core values and design philosophy. Each color plays a strategic role across our interface, illustrations, and brand communication.
