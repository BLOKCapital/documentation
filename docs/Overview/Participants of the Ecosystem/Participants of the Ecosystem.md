Before moving on and describing the key mechanics of the system, it is imperative to introduce

The participants within the BLOK Capital ecosystem:

1. **Investors (aka Garden Owners)** - users of the platform that have set up an account and have added various wallets of existing wealth onto the platform. They have now set up their garden of wealth and are able to select a Gardener to manage and grow it.  
2. **Wealth Managers (aka Gardeners)** - users of the platform that are available to Garden Owners to select as asset managers that will manage their wealth in their Garden. A smart contract based agreement is made to define tenure, management fees, early exit fees and any other contractual arrangement required.
3. **Stakers** - Stakers are those users who have staked BLOKC tokens. More about this can be found in the Tokenomics section.  
4. **The DAO Community** - All the individual owners of BLOKC tokens in BLOK Capital, who together will form the total decision making control of the DAO through votes.The DAO as part of their membership to community will provide project submissions to grow the DAO and also maintain the DAO. This ambidextrous approach to managing the DAO will ensure that its longevity in the market exists and will prove to be a well managed, growth attracting, talent retention and attraction vehicle for investment.
