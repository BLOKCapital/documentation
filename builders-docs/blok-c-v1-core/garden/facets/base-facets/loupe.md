# Loupe

The Loupe module is entirely read-only. It provides the introspection functions required by EIP-2535, allowing block explorers, frontends, and indexing bots to "see" inside the Garden and map out its capabilities.

## `DiamondLoupeBase.sol` & `DiamondLoupeFacet.sol`

These contracts implement the standard `IDiamondLoupe` interface. Because a Garden's capabilities can change over time (via upgrades), UIs should use these functions to verify if a Garden supports a specific action before sending a transaction.

It also implements `IERC165`, allowing other contracts to query `supportsInterface(bytes4)`.

**Key Introspection Functions for Builders:**

- `facets()`: Returns all active facet addresses and their bundled function selectors.
- `facetFunctionSelectors(address _facet)`: Returns all functions bundled in a specific facet.
- `facetAddress(bytes4 _functionSelector)`: Returns the exact facet address handling a specific function.

**Crucial Snippet: Querying a Selector**

Builders can use this to dynamically check if a Garden has a specific feature installed:

```solidity
// From DiamondLoupeBase.sol
/// @notice Retrieves the facet that supports the given function selector
function _facetAddress(bytes4 _functionSelector) internal view returns (address facetAddress_) {
    // Looks up the specific routing mapping in Diamond Storage
    facetAddress_ = DiamondCutStorage.layout().selectorToFacetAndPosition[_functionSelector].facetAddress;
}
```

## `DiamondLoupeStorage.sol`

Stores the mappings for ERC-165 interface detection (`mapping(bytes4 => bool) supportedInterfaces`). This is initialized when the Garden is first deployed.
