This relationship between protocols and the application layer is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer (or User interface). It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” applications.

Our product development team will be working on ways to reduce protocol operating costs, build better products, and invent radical new ones to succeed.
  
By focusing on development on the Protocol we shall build a basic User Interface similar to the way Curve DAO has [https://curve.fi/](https://curve.fi/) . As with the Curve DAO mobile phone applications for both iPhone and Android will not be necessary as the simple UI website will also work on mobile devices from day 1. The mobile UIs will be PWAs or Progressive Web Applications which combine the ease of access of classic web pages and the user-friendliness of mobile apps. PWA saves users time because the page renders faster, downloads less data, and is more interactive. This architecture allows the separation of the back end from the front end and therefore is much easier for optimization of services, experimentation, etc.

With our focus on thin UIs, this allows cryptofunds to launch quickly using the BLOKC Protocol as community developers can take the UI quickly and port to the exact requirements of a Wealth Managers Fund that would like to launch using the BLOKC Protocol.
