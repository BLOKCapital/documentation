# Lend

The Lend function allows users to deposit their crypto assets into integrated lending protocols (such as Aave or Compound) directly from their Garden. 
This functionality enables:

- Passive income generation on idle assets
- Risk-adjusted exposure to the DeFi credit market
- Automated yield strategies based on portfolio preferences

Lending through the Garden interface abstracts away the complexities of interacting with external protocols, offering a smooth, unified experience.
