# Governance & Voting in BLOKC DAO

BLOK Capital will be a pure DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and governed by the community with a flat hierarchical structure, a true on-chain Blockchain Organisation.

BLOK Capital will implement a DAO:

- The BLOK Capital governance model enables BLOKC token holders to participate in policies and protocol decisions on the platform. The amount of BLOKC tokens that a user holds is proportional to their voting power on the platform.
- The voting power of a user gives them the right to participate in policy making, proposals, and to have a say in any future direction of the platform.
- The DAO has Smart Contracts that form the backend of the platform.
- The DAO maintains the transaction records and rules that must be implemented on the blockchain for BLOK Capitalâ€™s protocols.

The voting process will take place on the DAO governance platform Aragon. This makes it extremely easy for the average user to create and vote on proposals.

For the ordinary course of protocol progression, the DAO will vote and need to be supported with a majority over 50% with a quorum of 5% to approve any proposal.
