### Phase 1 - Launch of V1 of the platform

We shall develop the first functional version of the platform with a website to enable Investors and Wealth Managers to connect and start working together on wealth management. We are focusing on building a strong community and listening to feedback right from the beginning.

All corresponding smart contracts will be developed and deployed onto the Blockchain and then tested by third party experts to ensure there are no coding errors. It is important to write clean, memory efficient and high functional code with zero points of failure. Specialist code analysers will also be used to help developers build safe and stable code. Examples of these analyzers are Solium and Open-Zeppelin. 

To ensure the code base is ready for launch, we shall then acquire full security certifications by  running smart contract audits from both Open-Zeppelin and CertiK in parallel.

Once all potential outstanding issues are resolved following the reports by these independently run audits and we receive both certifications we are ready to launch BLOK Capital V1.

#### A Strong Community and Platform User base from Day 1 of Launch

We are extremely aware that a protocol should have as many users as possible as quickly as possible after platform launch.

We therefore have devised the following plan to ensure a large immediate user base from Day 1 by ensuring each IDO participant also becomes an immediate user of the platform, not just an investor.

On IDO, BLOK Capital expects a large number of distinct, independent investors (or IDO participants) and due to us selecting the IDO approach we also benefit from a strong coin distribution with no single holder being a majority in line with a well run DAO. Indeed, through a successfully run IDO, IDO participants will have a limit of how many BLOKC tokens they can purchase.
