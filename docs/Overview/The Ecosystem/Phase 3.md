### Phase 3 - the Metaverse

We shall continue to develop the platform as per the DAOs recommendation. We shall build our offices in the Metaverse, our BLOK Capital headquarters to facilitate:

1. Blok Capital Annual Conference inviting all Wealth Managers and Investors to connect with Virtual Stands for each Wealth Manager. Similar to conferences today each stand will come at a cost in BLOKC and advertising packages for the conference will be available from digital billboards to Conference Passes. Again, these are all payable in BLOKC.

2. A Wealth Managerâ€™s Conference in a huge auditorium full of invited investors and potential new investors. Wealth Managers can pay in BLOKC to reserve the auditorium.

3. Private Meetings between an Investor and Wealth Managers. These meetings can range from an Investor deciding to select a particular Wealth Manager and meeting with them in the Metaverse to discuss their requirements. Alternatively an Investor waiting to have a private meeting to discuss progress so far by a particular Wealth Manager.
