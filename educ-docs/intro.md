# Education section

The Education section of our documentation explores the technical foundations and architectural principles behind our protocol. It is designed for readers who want to go beyond high-level concepts and develop a deeper, structured understanding of how the system operates under the hood.

This section offers clear, well-scoped technical insights that enable confident decision-making, smooth integration, and thoughtful evaluationâ€”without requiring readers to dive into low-level implementation details. It strikes a balance between accessibility and depth, making complex ideas easier to grasp while still capturing their essential mechanics.

This section will continue to grow over time as we expand coverage of critical components and mechanisms.
