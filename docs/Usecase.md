# Use Cases

1. **Non-Custodial Investment Management for Fund Managers:**
   The BLOKC protocol enables professional fund managers to actively manage their clients' portfolios without taking custody of the clients' assets. This preserves client ownership and security while allowing managers to deploy capital across decentralized financial strategies in a transparent and verifiable manner.

2. **Trustless Investorâ€“Manager Relationships:**
   The protocol facilitates investment relationships between individual investors and wealth managers, with all interactions governed by smart contracts. This ensures that all terms and actions are executed automatically and immutably according to predefined logic, reducing reliance on personal trust or centralized intermediaries.

3. **Global Access to Decentralized Asset Management:**
   The protocol operates entirely on-chain and is accessible globally without restrictions of time, geography, or intermediaries. This allows wealth managers and investors to engage with the protocol at any time, fostering continuous and borderless financial collaboration.
