# Garden Indices
A market-cap weighted index assigns weights to assets proportional to their market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of the portfolio (or basket).
Here’s a structured **overview of market-cap weighted indexes**, based on the content of the document you uploaded.

## 1. Concept of Market-Cap Weighting

A **market-cap weighted index** assigns weights to assets proportional to their market capitalization relative to the total market capitalization of the portfolio (or basket).

**Formula:**

This ensures that larger companies or tokens (by market value) exert more influence on the index.

## 2. Steps in Construction & Rebalancing

1. **Gather Data**

   * Market capitalization of each asset.
   * Current dollar value held.
   * Asset prices.
   * Total portfolio value.

2. **Calculate Target Weights**

   * Divide each asset’s market cap by the sum of all caps.
   * Example: If A = 500B, B = 300B, C = 200B → weights = 50%, 30%, 20%.

3. **Compare to Current Holdings**

   * Identify deviations between current and target values.

4. **Rebalance When Needed**

   * Sell overweight assets, buy underweight ones.
   * Match buy/sell so there’s no net cash flow.
   * Trade in whole shares/tokens.

## 3. Tolerance & Cost Efficiency

* **Tolerance threshold:** A set percentage (e.g., 5% of portfolio value) defines when trades are triggered.

  * Small deviations below threshold are ignored (avoids over-trading).
  * Example: On a \$20,000 portfolio with 5% tolerance (\$1,000), trades are only executed if deviations exceed \$1,000.
* **Transaction cost minimization:**

  * Fewer trades = lower fees.
  * Batch trades if managing multiple accounts.
  * Consider bid-ask spreads for cost/benefit.


### Proposed architecture(WIP)

### Trade samples

Let’s work through **three illustrative scenarios** with WETH and ARB, where we compare **target weights** vs. **calculated (current) weights** under a 5% tolerance rule.

---

#### Assumptions

* Portfolio Value = **\$10,000**
* Asset Prices:

  * WETH = **\$2,000**
  * ARB = **\$1.00**
* Target Weights:

  * WETH = **70%**
  * ARB = **30%**
* Tolerance: **+5% of total portfolio value (\$500)** — swaps are performed only if they improve the portfolio value by at least this much.

---

#### Case 1: **Target weight = Current weight → No swap**

* Current holdings:

  * WETH = 3.5 (\$7,000 value, 70%)
  * ARB = 3,000 (\$3,000 value, 30%)
* Current weights = Target weights (70/30).

**Action:** No swap required. Portfolio is aligned with targets.

---

#### Case 2: **Target weight higher → Swap performed**

Suppose current portfolio is:

* WETH = 3 (\$6,000, 60%)
* ARB = 4,000 (\$4,000, 40%)
* Current weights: WETH 60%, ARB 40%.
* Target: WETH 70%, ARB 30%.

To rebalance:

* WETH target = \$7,000. Currently \$6,000 → need **+\$1,000 WETH**.
* ARB target = \$3,000. Currently \$4,000 → need **–\$1,000 ARB**.

Swap \$1,000 ARB → WETH.

* Post-swap:

  * WETH = \$7,000 (70%)
  * ARB = \$3,000 (30%).

**Value shift = \$1,000 > \$500 tolerance → Swap executed.**

---

#### Case 3: **Target weight higher, but below tolerance → No swap**

Suppose current portfolio is:

* WETH = 3.3 (\$6,600, 66%)
* ARB = 3,400 (\$3,400, 34%)
* Current weights: WETH 66%, ARB 34%.
* Target: WETH 70%, ARB 30%.

To rebalance:

* WETH target = \$7,000. Currently \$6,600 → need **+\$400 WETH**.
* ARB target = \$3,000. Currently \$3,400 → need **–\$400 ARB**.

Swap size = \$400.

* This is **< \$500 tolerance**, so **no swap performed**.
* Portfolio remains slightly off-balance but within acceptable bounds.

---

### Summary

* **Case 1:** Perfectly aligned → no action.
* **Case 2:** Significant deviation → swap performed.
* **Case 3:** Deviation exists but below tolerance → no action.
