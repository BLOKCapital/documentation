# Abstract

BLOK Capital is building a revolutionary Investment Management protocol specifically designed for blockchain assets, connecting Investors and Wealth Managers, with the aim of offering complete transparency and control to Investors whilst also maintaining full custodial ownership of their Crypto assets.

Portfolio management has only been accessible for the wealthy few, with BLOK Capital’s protocol access to expert wealth management is financially inclusive, open to all walks of life.

The days of sending your hard earned money to fund managers are over and by employing blockchain technology all unnecessary middlemen are cut out.

# Introduction
BLOK Capital is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to be built and minted on the Ethereum scalable Layer 2 Blockchain called, Arbitrum for Investors and Wealth Managers to connect and work together. Unlike the traditional method of investing, where the Investor has to send their assets to a fund for management by an Wealth Manager, with BLOK Capital, Investors are always in direct control of their blockchain assets, as they are always held directly in their own corresponding wallets, and so never have to release them at any time to a 3rd party.

This arrangement can be managed because Wealth Managers will only be given access to the Investors’ wallets once terms between the two have been agreed through a blockchain-supported smart contract. The ensuing contract would determine tenure and management fees along with early exit costs.
 
Once the smart contract is established, the Wealth Manager will be given access to the Investors’ assets, granting them the ability to swap or trade assets within the Investors’ Wallets. It is important to note that by using smart contracts, a Wealth Manager is prevented from transferring an Investors’ blockchain assets outside of the Investors’ Wallets. An additional important feature of a smart contract based investment arrangement is that the relationship can be ended at any point by either party for whatever reason, giving the Investor total and immediate control of their assets.These are the fundamental principles of how BLOK Capital works, ensuring that Investors are always in full custody of their assets with full visibility at all times, including the ability to choose specific Wealth Manager(s) to have access to their wallets and assets to trade and grow their wealth.

We believe the unique features of BLOK Capital are the future of the  Investor / Wealth Manager relationship. We view this arrangement analogous to the relationship a Garden Owner has with their Gardener. That the Garden is always in full visibility, ownership and control to the Garden Owner and that they are given the pleasure of seeing their Garden everyday. That the Gardener is given the key to the Garden gate to be able to prune and feed the plants and trees to aid perfect growth of the Garden. Depending on the progress of a Gardener the Garden Owner will decide whether access to the Garden gate will continue day on day.

This completely new approach will revolutionise Cryptoasset Investment Management by using Blockchain technology and smart contracts. As one would expect from a Blockchain Protocol:
- this will remove any middle men between the relationship of Investor and Wealth Manager
- the protocol will be a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Together, we shall build and govern a blockchain protocol that enables decentralized wealth management for all classes of society, to reduce the wealth gap and drive financial inclusion.

# Our vision
We see a future where holders of Cryptoassets will want to connect and engage with asset managers to grow their wealth without having to release custody of their funds to anyone. Our BLOK Capital DAO will ensure that not only will this be possible, but it will be transparent and cut out all the middle men, thereby reducing unnecessary fees and leave the Investor in total control and ownership with complete visibility of their wealth each second or as they wish.

Specifically, we shall develop and govern a blockchain protocol that enables decentralized wealth management for all classes of society, to reduce the wealth gap and drive financial inclusion.

# Participants of the Ecosystem

Before moving on and describing the key mechanics of the system, it is imperative to introduce

The participants within the BLOK Capital ecosystem:

1. **Investors (aka Garden Owners)** - users of the platform that have set up an account and have added various wallets of existing wealth onto the platform. They have now set up their garden of wealth and are able to select a Gardener to manage and grow it.  
2. **Wealth Managers (aka Gardeners)** - users of the platform that are available to Garden Owners to select as asset managers that will manage their wealth in their Garden. A smart contract based agreement is made to define tenure, management fees, early exit fees and any other contractual arrangement required.
3. **Stakers** - Stakers are those users who have staked BLOKC tokens. More about this can be found in the Tokenomics section.  
4. **The DAO Community** - All the individual owners of BLOKC tokens in BLOK Capital, who together will form the total decision making control of the DAO through votes.The DAO as part of their membership to community will provide project submissions to grow the DAO and also maintain the DAO. This ambidextrous approach to managing the DAO will ensure that its longevity in the market exists and will prove to be a well managed, growth attracting, talent retention and attraction vehicle for investment.

# Why will we succeed ?

We believe investment in Cryptoassets will continue to grow significantly, whether it be in DAOs, Metaverse or Cryptocurrency projects. This will bring huge inflows of capital into the sector, and a growing Investor base. Many of these new Investors will need help in understanding which Cryptoassets will be more successful than another.

This growth will also give rise to a new wave of Wealth Managers who are professionals in valuing DAOs, Cryptos and Metaverse projects and the need for Investors to be able to select which of them will be the strongest performers. This means, someone who is time poor (a large proportion of Cryptoasset investors), can choose from a list of successful Wealth Managers and place a certain amount of their wealth with them. This is similar to the way investment funds work today, who have been equally successful. The difference is, this time, the investors will have full custody and control of their assets and be able to select investment experts in a much more transparent fashion with the benefit of full visibility and trust through the blockchain protocol. The days of sending your hard earned money to anyone to grow it are over!

At the same time, the crypto market has seen tremendous volatility, and some high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange and hedge fund that collapsed at the end of 2022, resulting in thousands of investors losing huge sums of money. Because of events like this, there are large numbers of potential Cryptoasset Investors eager to take part in the new age of Cryptoasset Investment, but too risk averse to invest because of the negative press that such events generate. FTX and other disasters could occur because these organisations were set up as traditionally registered and managed companies, outside of the blockchain, leaving them vulnerable to mismanagement and to the covert abuse of investor funds. Blok Capital will change all of that due to its open access DAO protocol, its blockchain built operating structure and token staking, which between them create a much more stable and visible environment for investors, safeguarding against the dramatic price swings seen in Cryptoassets, and through its underlying principle that each investor always retains full ownership of their assets, thus avoiding situations such that occurred at FTX, where management used FTX customer assets to cover trading losses. This would be impossible within the Blok Capital DAO platform. Blok Capital’s trust environment will therefore attract those new Investors that are looking for a more stable, low risk and open trading experience.

# The Ecosystem
The development of the BLOK Capital Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem will be progressive and highly transparent. As all the team strongly believes in the vision of the project, we also believe that ultimately, the purpose of such a platform is to give value back to the users, whether they are high net-worth investors or small investors just starting out with crypto-based investments. For this, the BLOK Capital DeFi project is broken down into two phases, with a long-term outlook for development.

Imagine a future where you don’t have to depend on any financial institution to take part in various financial opportunities. BLOK Capital DeFi will be a space where users of all walks of life can avail of financial services without having to be blockchain or crypto investment experts.  

It will be a space that runs on the principles of full custody and freedom of your wealth along with full transparency and the highest security. Everything will be secured through a blockchain backbone, one that starts out by delivering the vision but then evolves as the technology matures, and with that, new features and security measures will be added.

### Fat protocol, Thin application layer(UI)
This relationship between protocols and the application layer is reversed in the blockchain application stack. Value concentrates at the shared protocol layer and only a fraction of that value is distributed along at the applications layer (or User interface). It’s a stack with “fat” protocols and “thin” applications.

Our product development team will be working on ways to reduce protocol operating costs, build better products, and invent radical new ones to succeed.
  
By focusing on development on the Protocol we shall build a basic User Interface similar to the way Curve DAO has [https://curve.fi/](https://curve.fi/) . As with the Curve DAO mobile phone applications for both iPhone and Android will not be necessary as the simple UI website will also work on mobile devices from day 1. The mobile UIs will be PWAs or Progressive Web Applications which combine the ease of access of classic web pages and the user-friendliness of mobile apps. PWA saves users time because the page renders faster, downloads less data, and is more interactive. This architecture allows the separation of the back end from the front end and therefore is much easier for optimization of services, experimentation, etc.

With our focus on thin UIs, this allows cryptofunds to launch quickly using the BLOKC Protocol as community developers can take the UI quickly and port to the exact requirements of a Wealth Managers Fund that would like to launch using the BLOKC Protocol.

### Phase 1 - Launch of V1 of the platform
We shall develop the first functional version of the platform with a website to enable Investors and Wealth Managers to connect and start working together on wealth management. We are focusing on building a strong community and listening to feedback right from the beginning.

All corresponding smart contracts will be developed and deployed onto the Blockchain and then tested by third party experts to ensure there are no coding errors. It is important to write clean, memory efficient and high functional code with zero points of failure. Specialist code analysers will also be used to help developers build safe and stable code. Examples of these analyzers are Solium and Open-Zeppelin. 

To ensure the code base is ready for launch, we shall then acquire full security certifications by  running smart contract audits from both Open-Zeppelin and CertiK in parallel.

Once all potential outstanding issues are resolved following the reports by these independently run audits and we receive both certifications we are ready to launch BLOK Capital V1.

#### A Strong Community and Platform User base from Day 1 of Launch

We are extremely aware that a protocol should have as many users as possible as quickly as possible after platform launch.

We therefore have devised the following plan to ensure a large immediate user base from Day 1 by ensuring each IDO participant also becomes an immediate user of the platform, not just an investor.

On IDO, BLOK Capital expects a large number of distinct, independent investors (or IDO participants) and due to us selecting the IDO approach we also benefit from a strong coin distribution with no single holder being a majority in line with a well run DAO. Indeed, through a successfully run IDO, IDO participants will have a limit of how many BLOKC tokens they can purchase.

### Phase 2- Attract More Wealth Managers and Investors

We shall start attracting more Wealth Managers onto the platform along with Investors through a marketing phase whilst continuing to add more features to the platform, all proposed and decided upon by the Community. This phase will ensure our platform is even more efficient on gas fees (the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction, such as a swap, or the execution a contract on the blockchain). 

Fees are priced as a small percentage of swap fees to ensure scalable growth. All functional improvements shall be managed and implemented by the community, who will now also be users of the protocol and will be best placed to propose functional requirements they believe are required to continue to keep the protocol at the forefront of Investment Management on the blockchain to launch BLOK Capital V2.

### Phase 3 - the Metaverse

We shall continue to develop the platform as per the DAOs recommendation. We shall build our offices in the Metaverse, our BLOK Capital headquarters to facilitate:

1. Blok Capital Annual Conference inviting all Wealth Managers and Investors to connect with Virtual Stands for each Wealth Manager. Similar to conferences today each stand will come at a cost in BLOKC and advertising packages for the conference will be available from digital billboards to Conference Passes. Again, these are all payable in BLOKC.

2. A Wealth Manager’s Conference in a huge auditorium full of invited investors and potential new investors. Wealth Managers can pay in BLOKC to reserve the auditorium.

3. Private Meetings between an Investor and Wealth Managers. These meetings can range from an Investor deciding to select a particular Wealth Manager and meeting with them in the Metaverse to discuss their requirements. Alternatively an Investor waiting to have a private meeting to discuss progress so far by a particular Wealth Manager.

### Service DAOs

To make the BLOK Capital project benefit from existing functionality that already exists on the blockchain, we will integrate with the following Service DAOs so as not to reinvent the wheel and where the costs to do so are cost effective. This will reduce the time needed for development of Phase 1 and therefore allow us to launch faster. The Service DAOs we have selected to integrate with are:
  
- **Uniswap** : We will integrate multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) for the future but will first integrate with UniSwap as a first measure to handle our trading requirements. In the future we will make requests to all DEXs simultaneously to decide which DEX we would choose to make the trade on. This would be another benefit users would get by using our Investment Management Platform.
- **Streamflow.Finance** : on-chain tokenomics and payroll protocol has been selected to manage payment of any DAO worker deemed fit by the community. They will also provide project contributors with a dashboard of the tokenomics independently showing the token vesting and locks to provide full transparency and confidence to token owners.
- **Gnosis**: the most trusted platform to manage digital assets EVM Multichain. To manage our DAO Treasury multiple team members will confirm every transaction in order to execute it using the Gnosis Multisig Vault.

# DAO Governance
BLOK Capital will be a pure DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) and governed by the community with a flat hierarchical structure, a true on-chain Blockchain Organisation.

BLOK Capital will implement a DAO:

- The BLOK Capital governance model enables BLOKC token holders to participate in policies and protocol decisions on the platform. The amount of BLOKC tokens that a user holds is proportional to their voting power on the platform.
- The voting power of a user gives them the right to participate in policy making, proposals, and to have a say in any future direction of the platform.
- The DAO has Smart Contracts that form the backend of the platform.
- The DAO maintains the transaction records and rules that must be implemented on the blockchain for BLOK Capital’s protocols.

The voting process will take place on the DAO governance platform Aragon. This makes it extremely easy for the average user to create and vote on proposals.

For the ordinary course of protocol progression, the DAO will vote and need to be supported with a majority over 50% with a quorum of 5% to approve any proposal.

# Tokenomics
The following section will describe the token of the BLOK Capital ecosystem, with its native token, BLOKC, at its core. 
 
All the key features of the platform are enabled by BLOKC tokenomics. In this way, BLOKC is the lifeblood of the protocol and provides a game theoretically coherent framework that stimulates Investors and Wealth Managers behavior to facilitate growth of the ecosystem.
### Token utility

Our token will be used for the following:

- Governance of the Blok Capital Platform
- Medium of exchange on the platform between investors and wealth managers to handle payment of fees.
- Platform fees payable by both investors and wealth managers and other future actors involved with the platform.
- Rewards for the introduction of new clients by existing investors to the platform or by any actor introducing an investor to the platform.
- Rewards for being a certain level of Investor or Wealth Manager. Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond by staking the token.
- Rewards opportunities via activities such as staking to help secure the platform and make it more stable.
### Behavioral economics

The key market that the protocol is trying to serve is to connect professional medium and long term wealth managers with novice investors who are time poor and need professional help to try and invest in the complexities of Crypto Assets.

Indeed, in the market sizing section, we make it absolutely clear we are going for this market and not professional high velocity traders or more risk ready investors. We shall leave this to other protocols. We believe focus is everything and we also believe this is an incredibly big market for the protocol to serve.

Using the BLOKC Token we shall reward investors for good investment behavior and equally not reward them for bad behavior.
Some examples:
- An investor who doesn’t touch this investment for 1 year will receive BLOKC tokens as a reward for good behavior.
- An investor who sells or changes advisors throughout the year will receive no incentivisation.

We shall employ the services of an advisor experienced in Behavioral economics and tokenomics so we can keep a constant eye on the behavior of our protocol users to ensure we are aligning incentives across all stakeholders to hold the token and be long term investors / users of the protocol. This was explained more in the Flywheel section above.

Rewarding Good behavior, punishing poor behavior forces our users to become rewarded happy protocol users.

# Conclusion

The aim of BLOK Capital is to enable financial inclusivity by enabling all walks of life to have access to the services of expert wealth managers but, at the same time, always have custody of their funds.

It is clear following the demise of exchanges like FTX that we need more protocols that run on the blockchain as a DAO. In this way investors can be sure their funds are not being managed in any way by a centralized authority or CeFi.

Furthermore it is vital that the custody of the investors funds or wealth is always with the investor themselves.

The BLOK Capital platform ensures both the above two points are operational, furthermore allows for a new paradigm with the option for wealth managers to be able to manage money on behalf of investors in the way gardeners manage gardens for garden owners. We believe as the interest in Crypto asset Investing continues to rise, the BLOK Capital protocol will see exponential growth in its use.
