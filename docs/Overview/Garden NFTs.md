# Garden NFTs 

### NFTs as Art and Ownership

- NFTs play an integral part for maintaining ownership of Gardens. 
- Each garden is uniquely identifies with a NFT, which represents the ownership of the Garden with it's owner. 
- A single user can have multiple Gardens, which means they would hold multiple NFTs to prove their ownership.

But now it gets interesting, NFTs at BLOK Capital are not just a key to maintain ownership of Gardens, they also double down as real pieces of art. 
We will onboard generative artists, and launch their collections. 

Artists get to display their unique pieces of art and our users know each garden has real value attached. It's not just a piece of code on the blockchain. In this way we are bringing back the era of NFTs by supporting artists and helping them bring their community to BLOK Capital and grow their brand. For every piece an artist lists on the protocol they get a royalty, so the artists not only get paid during the sale of their NFTs but they also generate a source of recurring revenue. 

> **The users must hold their respective Garden NFTs to maintain the ownership of their Gardens, if the NFT is transferred they might loose their garden**

NFTs would also represent what features a particular garden has, for specific collection of NFTs the respecive Gardens would have unique features such as lifetime no tx fees, etc.
