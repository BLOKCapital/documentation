# Ownership

The ownership module provides standard ERC-173 administrative control but stores the state securely within the Diamond Storage pattern to prevent collisions during upgrades.

## Core Concept: ERC-173 Standard Integration

This module provides the baseline access control for the Garden. The owner (usually the user or a DAO) holds the right to manage the Garden when it is operating independently.

## `OwnershipFacet.sol` & `OwnershipBase.sol`

- `OwnershipFacet` exposes the external `transferOwnership(address)` and `owner()` functions.
- The `transferOwnership` function is guarded by the `onlyGardenOwner` modifier, ensuring only the current administrator can pass the baton.

## `OwnershipStorage.sol`

Like all state variables in Blok Capital, the owner address is stored at a deterministic slot to guarantee it survives upgrades without memory corruption.

**Crucial Builder Snippet: Ownership Storage Layout**

```solidity
/// @dev Storage slot is derived from keccak256(bytes("OwnershipStorage"))
struct Layout {
    /// @notice Address of the owner. When zero, no owner is set (renounced).
    address owner;
}

function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage l) {
    bytes32 position = LibStorageSlot.deriveStorageSlot(type(OwnershipStorage).name);
    assembly {
        l.slot := position
    }
}
```
