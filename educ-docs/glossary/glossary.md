## Core Architecture (Diamond Pattern / EIP-2535)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Diamond | The main upgradeable proxy contract (Garden) that routes function calls to facets based on selectors. Central to EIP-2535. |
| Facet | A contract implementing specific functionality, registered with the Diamond and called via delegatecall. |
| Function Selector | 4-byte identifier (bytes4) derived from a function signature hash, used to route calls to the correct facet. |
| Facet Cut | A data structure containing a facet address, action (Add/Replace/Remove), and selectors to modify. |
| Facet Cut Action | Enum: Add (0), Replace (1), Remove (2) — determines how the Diamond is modified. |
| DiamondCut | The function that applies facet cuts to modify the Diamond's routing table. |
| DiamondLoupe | Query interface for inspecting a Diamond's current facets, selectors, and routing. |
| Module | Logical grouping of related facets. Each facet belongs to exactly one module. |
| Base Module | Immutable module (keccak256("BASE")) containing the 4 core facets — always included in every Garden. |
| Delegatecall | Low-level EVM call that executes external code in the calling contract's storage context. |

## Garden & Factory

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Garden | The Diamond contract (user's vault) that holds tokens and implements strategies through facets. |
| Index Garden | The Garden that the user connects to the index which gets rebalanced automatically. |
| Yield Garden | The Garden that the users manages by themselves and uses different strategies to grow it. |
| GardenFactory | Factory contract deploying new Gardens via CREATE2 deterministic deployment. |
| Garden Index | Numeric value (1-10) uniquely identifying one of a user's Gardens for deterministic address calculation. |
| Garden Type | Categorization of a Garden that determines which optional modules it can use. |
| Garden Owner | The address that created/owns a Garden and controls its operations. |
| Facet Registry | Central registry managing all facets, modules, garden types, and their versions. |

## Index & Rebalancing

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Index | A contract managing a diversified portfolio of asset components with calculated weights. |
| Index Component | An ERC20 token included in an Index's composition, paired with a Chainlink price feed. |
| Index Calculation Strategy | Pluggable contract that computes asset weights (e.g., MarketCapWeighted). |
| Rebalance | Process of adjusting Garden holdings to match target Index allocations. |
| Rebalance Intent | A pending rebalance containing current values, target values, and weights for all components. |
| Rebalance Interval | Minimum time (1 hour) between consecutive rebalances. |
| Swap Call | Individual swap instruction from CRE containing selector, encoded data, output token, and minimum output. |
| Component Weights | Normalized allocation percentages for Index components (scaled to 1e18). |
| Market Cap Weighted | Strategy that weights components proportionally to their market cap. |

## Protocol Governance & Status

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Protocol Status | Enum: ACTIVE, UPGRADES_DISABLED, or INACTIVE — controls protocol-level behavior. |
| Security Council Member (SCM) | DAO members tracked via ENS who can authorize protocol state changes. |
| ENS Namehash | Hash identifier of an ENS domain used to track SCM membership. |

## DEX & Liquidity

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Liquidity Pool | AMM pool registered in the LiquidityPoolRegistry for token swapping. |
| DEX ID | bytes32 identifier for a DEX platform (e.g., keccak256("UNISWAP_V3")). |
| Pair ID | Canonical identifier (keccak256 of ordered token addresses) for a token pair across all DEXes. |
| Fee Tier | Fee percentage for concentrated liquidity pools (uint24: 500, 3000, 10000 basis points). |
| Exact Input Swap | Swap with a fixed input amount and variable output. |
| Exact Output Swap | Swap with a fixed output amount and variable input. |
| Slippage Protection | Min output (amountOutMin) or max input (amountInMax) to prevent unfavorable swaps. |
| Swap Path | Sequence of token hops for multi-pool swaps (e.g., WETH -> USDC -> DAI). |
| TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) | Oracle price from historical observations, resistant to flash loan manipulation. |
| Sqrt Price X96 | Uniswap V3's internal price representation in Q64.96 fixed-point format. |

## Cross-Chain (CCTP)

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| CCTP | Circle Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for bridging USDC across chains. |
| Destination Domain | Circle domain ID for a blockchain (1 = Ethereum, 42161 = Arbitrum, etc.). |
| TokenMessengerV2 | Circle contract for initiating cross-chain USDC burns. |
| MessageTransmitterV2 | Circle contract for receiving/verifying cross-chain messages. |

## NFT & Membership

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Reward Collection | ERC721 NFT collection minted by Gardens to track their own contributions. |
| SBT (Soulbound Token) | Non-transferable NFT (ERC-5484) representing membership. |
| SBT Registry | Registry managing SBT collections and minting permissions. |

## Storage & Internals

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Storage Layout (EIP-7201) | Namespaced storage using LibStorageSlot to prevent slot collisions across facets. |
| LibDiamond | Core library storing Diamond metadata (facetRegistry, protocolStatus, gardenType, etc.). |
| Price Feed / Heartbeat | Chainlink AggregatorV3 oracle; heartbeat is max staleness interval before data is considered stale. |
| Self-call | A Garden calling its own Diamond proxy (msg.sender == address(this)) for internal facet composability. |
