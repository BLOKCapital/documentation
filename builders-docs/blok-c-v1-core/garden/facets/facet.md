# Facet.sol

## Access Layer: `Facet.sol`

- `Facet.sol` acts as the **base contract** for all logic modules in the Garden.
- It defines the **core access control rules** that every module follows.
- Its primary role is to **protect the system from unauthorized or unsafe actions**, especially during sensitive operations.

---

## Main idea: Restricted Interactions During Index Connection

- When a Garden is connected to an Index, certain operations become **more restrictive**.
- **Direct user interaction is limited** during automated processes like rebalancing.
- This helps prevent:
  - **Front-running** (users exploiting timing for profit)
  - **State inconsistencies** caused by unexpected external actions

---

## DEX Caller Restriction

- During a rebalance, **swap functions can only be executed by the Garden contract itself**.
- **External users or contracts are not allowed** to trigger these swaps.
- This restriction ensures:
  - Controlled execution of trades
  - No external interference
  - Consistent and predictable system behavior

```solidity
/// @notice Checks if the caller is the garden itself when connected to an index
function _onlyGardenCanCallDexWhenIndexConnected() internal view {
    LibDiamond.Layout storage ld = LibDiamond.layout();
    if (ld.isConnectedToIndex) {
        // Enforce Diamond self-calls only
        if (msg.sender != address(this)) {
            revert Garden_OnlyGardenCanCallDexWhenIndexConnected();
        }
    } else {
        // If not connected to an index, fallback to owner validation
        if (msg.sender != OwnershipStorage.layout().owner) {
            revert Garden_UnauthorizedCaller();
        }
    }
}
```
