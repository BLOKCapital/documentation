# Upgrade

As `diamondCut` is blocked in the Base Facets, the **Upgrade Module** is the only authorized way to alter a Garden's logic. It relies on a deterministic, version-controlled sync with the global `FacetRegistry`.

## Main focus: Hash-Verified Upgrades

Instead of passing an array of arbitrary function selectors and addresses, a caller must provide a `_hashData` payload. The `UpgradeBase` (internal logic) compares this hash against the official `FacetRegistry`. If the hash matches the authorized module versions for that Garden Type, the upgrade is pulled and executed securely.

## `UpgradeFacet.sol` (The Executor)

This facet exposes the external interface for upgrading the Garden and checking installed module versions.

**Crucial Builder Snippet: The Smart Upgrade Modifier**

Notice the `onlyOwnerUnlessIndexConnected` modifier. This is a brilliant architectural decision for automated portfolio management.

If the Garden is connected to an Index, *anyone* (including an automated bot) can trigger the `upgrade` function. Because the upgrade relies on a strict hash verified by the global Facet Registry, it is immune to malicious injection. This allows the protocol to automatically patch connected Gardens without requiring manual user signatures.

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IUpgrade
function upgrade(bytes32 _hashData) external onlyOwnerUnlessIndexConnected nonReentrant {
    // Executes the registry-verified upgrade using the provided hash
    _upgrade(_hashData);
}

/// @inheritdoc IUpgrade
function upgradeDetails() external view returns (IDiamondCut.FacetCut[] memory facetCuts, bytes32 hashData) {
    // Returns the pending cuts and the hash required to execute them
    (facetCuts, hashData) = _upgradeDetails();
}
```

## `UpgradeStorage.sol`

Rather than tracking every single function selector (which is handled by `DiamondCutStorage`), this specific storage layout tracks **Module Versions**.

**Crucial Builder Snippet: Version Tracking**

By tracking versions, the protocol knows exactly which components of the Garden are out of date compared to the global registry, allowing for precise, modular updates.

```solidity
/// @dev Tracks per-module versions only. Upgrade logic is driven by module versions;
///      the garden installs only modules allowed for its type
struct Layout {
    // Maps the Module ID (e.g., keccak256("DEX")) to its currently installed version
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) moduleVersions;
}
```
