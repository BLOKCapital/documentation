#  Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)

At BLOK Capital, we use Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to keep your crypto secure—without needing a traditional private key or seed phrase.

### What is MPC?

MPC is a way for different computers or parties to work together to approve something—like a transaction—without anyone ever seeing or holding the full private key. Instead, the key is broken into smaller parts (called *shares*) and kept in different places. Only when enough of these parts come together can the action be completed.

This means no single person or device ever has the full key, making it much harder for anyone to steal your crypto.

### Why We Use It ?

Traditional wallets use a single private key or seed phrase. If someone loses it or it gets stolen, their funds are at risk. With MPC, that risk is removed because there’s **no single key to lose or steal**.

Here’s how it helps:
- **No single point of failure**: Your key is never stored in one place.
- **Safer transactions**: A transaction only goes through when enough parts of the key work together.
- **Proven security**: This same technology is used by major crypto companies—and now BLOK Capital uses it to make decentralized systems safer for everyone.

### How It Works at BLOK Capital?

We use MPC behind the scenes in key parts of our platform—from authorizing transactions to managing DAO actions. It helps us offer stronger protection and more reliable systems, while still keeping things simple for our users.

With MPC, BLOK Capital combines top-tier security with a smooth experience—no seed phrases, no risky backups, just safe and secure crypto interaction.
