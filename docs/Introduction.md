## What is BLOK Capital?

**BLOK Capital** lets you grow your crypto wealth without ever giving up control.

You can follow professionally selected crypto indices (like a Standard & Poor’s 500 Index ) for crypto or manage everything yourself with built-in DeFi tools. Either way, your assets never leave your wallet.

 **It’s totally Your assets. Your control.**

## Why "BLOK Capital"?

Our founder Mr. Sheetal Nehra wanted a name which could actually define the product we offer.

**BLOK** = We're blockchain-first. Everything we do is built on the principles that make crypto powerful: transparency, decentralization, and code you can trust instead of middlemen you have to trust.

**Capital** = We're serious about growing your wealth. This isn't some DeFi experiment that'll be gone next year. We're building real wealth management for the long term the kind of serious financial infrastructure that traditional finance respects, but rebuilt the right way: on-chain.

Think of us as the infrastructure for how wealth will be managed in the future.

Our Motto: **It's Cryto but Diffrent**

This is what literally how the protocol works. You hold the keys, you make the decisions, and nobody can take that away from you.

## Why did we build BLOK Capital as a DAO?
We chose the DAO structure because we believe the community should have real control. Here's what that means for you:

When we need to upgrade the protocol, the community votes on it directly on the blockchain. The rules aren't enforced by some company that could change its mind tomorrow they're written into the code itself. We don't hold your funds in some corporate bank account. You maintain control. Big decisions about BLOK Capital's future? Those are made by token holders like you, not by a small group behind closed doors.

This approach gives us something traditional companies can't offer: complete transparency in how decisions are made, protection against censorship or arbitrary shutdowns, and a structure where everyone's incentives are aligned for the long haul. When the community succeeds, We all succeed.

## Investor Custody & Control

Unlike traditional models where investors hand over control of their assets to a fund, BLOK Capital ensures:

* Investors always retain custody of their assets.
* Assets stay in the investor’s wallet at all times.
* Wealth Managers never gain full control or withdrawal rights over the assets. -->

<!-- ---

## Smart Contract-Driven Agreements

All investor-manager relationships are governed by smart contracts:

* Define tenure, fees, and exit conditions.
* Grant Wealth Managers **limited access** to manage or trade assets.
* Restrict unauthorized transfers outside the investor’s wallet.
* Allow either party to end the contract at any time, giving the investor full control and flexibility. -->

## The Garden Analogy

**BLOK Capital** reimagines wealth management:

A **Garden** is your **personal** crypto portfolio on BLOK Capital where your assets live and grow.

**Garden Owner = Investor**: That means you have complete visibility into your portfolio and full control over your funds. Your assets never leave your wallet, and only you decide what happens to them.

---

## Why It Matters

This approach:

* Eliminates intermediaries.
* Establishes a transparent, peer-to-peer investment model.
* Promotes financial inclusion by democratizing access to wealth management tools.
