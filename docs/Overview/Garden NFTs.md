# Garden NFTs

### NFT Representing Ownership and Providing Art

* NFTs are the foundational mechanism for establishing and maintaining ownership of Gardens.
* Each Garden is uniquely identified through an NFT, which serves as an immutable proof of ownership recorded on-chain.
* A single user may own multiple Gardens, and by extension, multiple NFTs, each corresponding to a distinct Garden.

Beyond their core function as proof of ownership, Garden NFTs at BLOK Capital also serve as collectible works of generative art. Art gives personalization uniqueness and being connected with community. By curating and collaborating with artists, we ensure that each NFT is not only functional but also uniquely valuable as an artistic creation.


### Artists

Generative NFT artists occupy a central role within the BLOK Capital ecosystem. We provide a platform for artists to showcase their creativity while directly embedding their works into the fabric of the protocol. Each Garden NFT is a canvas, enabling artists to design unique, evolving, or algorithmically generated pieces that bring individuality to every Garden.

Artists launching collections with BLOK Capital gain access to an engaged community of collectors, investors, and participants who value both digital ownership and artistic authenticity. Through curated collaborations, BLOK Capital ensures that these collections are more than mere blockchain tokens—they are cultural assets, blending aesthetics with utility.

Furthermore, artists benefit from a sustainable revenue model:

* **Primary Sales:** Artists are compensated when their works are initially minted and sold as part of Garden NFTs.
* **Royalties:** Every subsequent transfer of these NFTs generates royalty revenue, ensuring artists share in the long-term success and cultural adoption of their work.
* **Community Growth:** By launching collections within the BLOK Capital protocol, artists can grow their brand, foster community engagement, and participate in cross-community initiatives between art and decentralized finance.

Through this model, BLOK Capital seeks to revitalize the cultural value of NFTs, restoring them as a medium for creativity, expression, and community building rather than purely speculative instruments.


### NFTs Define Features of Gardens

Garden NFTs go beyond static ownership—they also encode specific features, privileges, and utilities that differentiate one Garden from another. These features are tightly coupled to the collection or series of NFTs a user holds, allowing for unique and tiered experiences within the ecosystem.

Examples include:

* **Transaction Benefits:** Certain Garden NFT collections may grant owners privileges such as lifetime zero transaction fees or reduced protocol fees.
* **Exclusive Access:** NFTs can unlock entry to private community events, gated governance discussions, or early access to new protocol features.
* **Enhanced Functionality:** Gardens tied to specific NFT collections might include unique yield strategies, custom interfaces, or specialized integrations within the BLOK Capital protocol.
* **Collectible Perks:** Beyond protocol-level benefits, some collections may offer limited-edition art releases, real-world collaborations, or evolving generative traits tied to on-chain or off-chain events.

By linking features directly to NFT ownership, BLOK Capital ensures that NFTs are not ornamental but instrumental—driving personalization, incentivizing long-term participation, and fostering a deeper connection between users, their Gardens, and the broader ecosystem.
