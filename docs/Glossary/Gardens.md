# Gardens

Gardens are programmable crypto portfolios built using the ERC-2535 Diamond standard, allowing modular and upgradeable contract architecture. In simple terms, a Garden is your personal crypto portfolio that you can customize and manage freely. Each user can create and own multiple Gardens, representing different investment strategies or asset allocations.
