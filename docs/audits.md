# Audits and Security

At BLOK Capital, security isnâ€™t just a feature, itâ€™s our foundation. We are committed to ensuring that our smart contracts are as secure, reliable, and resilient as possible. To achieve this, we are taking a proactive approach by launching a bug bounty program on Immunefi and audit contests on Cantina and Code4rena.

### Why This Matters?
Smart contracts are powerful, but they must be battle-tested against vulnerabilities. By inviting top-tier security researchers and auditors to review our code, we aim to identify and eliminate potential risks before they can impact our users.

### Whatâ€™s Coming?
- **Bug Bounty**â€“ Ethical hackers and security researchers will have the chance to test our contracts and earn rewards for uncovering vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Contests** â€“ Some of the best security minds in Web3 will compete to find and fix issues in our smart contracts, ensuring maximum protection. 

While audit contests are crucial for thorough code reviews, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and fixed before deployment, a live bug bounty program provides continuous security. With our code openly accessible, security researchers can take their time to detect and report real-time vulnerabilities, keeping us secure at all times.
