# Protocol Subgraph

### 🔍 Subgraphs: Seamless Data Access for Web3 Applications

At BLOK Capital, we utilize **subgraphs** powered by **The Graph Protocol** to deliver fast, reliable, and decentralized access to DAO data—especially for proposal tracking and governance insights.

#### What is a Subgraph?

A **subgraph** is an open API that indexes blockchain data in real-time and makes it easily queryable using GraphQL. Instead of manually parsing through raw on-chain data, subgraphs organize this data into a structured, efficient format optimized for frontend applications and analytics.

#### Why We Use Subgraphs

In BLOK Capital, subgraphs allow us to fetch DAO proposal data directly from Aragon DAO contracts, enabling:

*  Real-time proposal updates
*  Efficient filtering and sorting of proposals
*  Seamless integration with our governance dashboards
*  Enhanced performance with no need for centralized servers

By leveraging subgraphs, BLOK Capital ensures that our users can interact with DAO governance in a **transparent, fast, and reliable** manner—making decentralized decision-making truly accessible.

#### Built on Decentralization

The Graph Protocol ensures that subgraphs remain **open-source**, **community-powered**, and **censorship-resistant**, aligning perfectly with our mission at BLOK Capital to build trustless financial infrastructure.
