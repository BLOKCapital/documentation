The key market that the protocol is trying to serve is to connect professional medium and long term wealth managers with novice investors who are time poor and need professional help to try and invest in the complexities of Crypto Assets.

Indeed, in the market sizing section, we make it absolutely clear we are going for this market and not professional high velocity traders or more risk ready investors. We shall leave this to other protocols. We believe focus is everything and we also believe this is an incredibly big market for the protocol to serve.

Using the BLOKC Token we shall reward investors for good investment behavior and equally not reward them for bad behavior.
Some examples:
- An investor who doesnâ€™t touch this investment for 1 year will receive BLOKC tokens as a reward for good behavior.
- An investor who sells or changes advisors throughout the year will receive no incentivisation.

We shall employ the services of an advisor experienced in Behavioral economics and tokenomics so we can keep a constant eye on the behavior of our protocol users to ensure we are aligning incentives across all stakeholders to hold the token and be long term investors / users of the protocol. This was explained more in the Flywheel section above.

Rewarding Good behavior, punishing poor behavior forces our users to become rewarded happy protocol users.
