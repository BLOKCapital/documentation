# Swap

The Swap function enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly from within their Garden using decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, SushiSwap, or other integrated protocols. E.g. exchanging ETH for USDC within a Garden to rebalance a portfolio or capitalize on market movements.

Swaps are performed by routing the token pair through the DEXâ€™s liquidity pools, and users receive the output token in return for their input token, minus slippage and fees.
