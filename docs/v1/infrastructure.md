## **5 Storage & State Management**

Diamond’s power comes with one big constraint: **all facets share storage**. To manage that safely, this repo uses **storage libraries**.

### **Shared Diamond storage pattern**

The pattern:

- Define a `struct Layout` containing variables for a specific concern.
- Fix a **storage slot** via a constant `bytes32` hash of a unique string.
- Provide a `layout()` function that returns a storage reference to that layout.

```solidity
library SomeStorage {
    bytes32 internal constant STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("some.unique.storage.slot");

    struct Layout {
        uint256 value;
        mapping(address => bool) allowed;
    }

    function layout() internal pure returns (Layout storage l) {
        bytes32 position = STORAGE_POSITION;
        assembly { l.slot := position }
    }
}
```

### **How facets safely access state**

Every stateful facet imports the relevant storage library and immediately grabs a reference:
`SomeStorage.Layout storage s = SomeStorage.layout();`

This ensures that each concern (ownership, loupe, index, etc.) has its own dedicated, non-overlapping storage space.

## **6 Runtime & Infrastructure**

### **LibDiamond**

**File:** `src/garden/libraries/LibDiamond.sol`

This is the **runtime kernel** for the Diamond. It owns the primary Diamond storage layout (selector-to-facet mapping) and provides core functions to perform cuts and enforce ownership.

### **OpenZeppelin libraries**

Used heavily for security and standards:

- `Ownable`: Access control.
- `IERC20`, `IERC20Metadata`: Token interactions.
- `SafeERC20`: Safe transfer operations.
- `Math`, `EnumerableSet`: Utility math and set operations.

### **What is infrastructure vs business logic**

- **Infrastructure**: mechanics like `LibDiamond`, storage libraries, and DEX interfaces. They don't encode protocol rules.
- **Business logic**: rules for index construction, pricing, and rebalancing.

Builders should be comfortable reading infrastructure but **cautious** about changing it, as it affects the entire system.

## **7 How a Builder Should Read This Repo**

If you’re new to this codebase, here’s a reading path that lines up with both your diagram and the repo:

### **Step 1 – Start at the entry point**

1. `src/garden/Garden.sol`
   - Understand:
     - That it’s a Diamond.
     - How it routes calls using `LibDiamond`.
   - Skim the constructor to see how initial facets are wired.

### **Step 2 – Explore base facets (kernel)**

1. `src/garden/facets/baseFacets/ownership/*`
   - See how ownership is stored and enforced.
2. `src/garden/facets/baseFacets/cut/*` and `.../upgrade/*`
   - Understand how diamond cuts work.
   - Note how selectors and facets are managed.
3. `src/garden/facets/baseFacets/loupe/*`
   - See how introspection is implemented.

At this point you know:

“Who owns the Garden, how it’s upgradeable, and how I can discover its capabilities.”

### **Step 3 – Explore feature facets**

1. `src/garden/facets/indexFacets/IIndex.sol`
   - Look at the external behavior: connect, disconnect, rebalance, check status.
2. `src/garden/facets/indexFacets/IndexBase.sol` + `IndexStorage.sol`
   - See how:
     - It pulls from registries and math libs.
     - It calls DEX/GMX utilities.
     - It uses Chainlink for pricing.
3. `src/garden/facets/utilityFacets/arbitrumOne/*`
   - Understand Uniswap / Camelot and GMX helper logic.

Here you understand:

“How a rebalance call on the Garden turns into a set of trades / position changes.”

### **Step 4 – Explore the domain layer**

1. `src/indices/Index.sol`
   - Learn what an index is in this protocol.
2. `src/indices/IndexFactory.sol`
   - See how indices are deployed and configured.
3. `src/indices/IndexComponentRegistry.sol`
   - Understand the whitelist of allowed tokens and price feeds.
4. `src/indices/IndexCalculationRegistry.sol`
   - See how strategies are registered and enforced.
5. `src/indices/libraries/IndexMath.sol`
   - Inspect the math that drives weights and valuations.

Now you know:

“What exactly an index is, how it’s constrained, and how values are computed.”

### **Step 5 – Storage & runtime details**

1. Storage libs:
   - `DiamondLoupeStorage.sol`
   - `OwnershipStorage.sol`
   - `DiamondCutStorage.sol`
   - `IndexStorage.sol`
   - `GmxV2Storage.sol`
2. `src/garden/libraries/LibDiamond.sol`

This is where you lock in your understanding of **how state is laid out** and how the Diamond works internally. You don’t need to read this first, but you should read it before making any low‑level changes.

### **Step 6 – External integrations & SBTs**

1. `src/interfaces/*`
   - `IProtocolStatus.sol`
   - `ICamelotRouterV3.sol`
   - `AggregatorV3Interface.sol`
   - `IERC173.sol`
2. `src/GardenSBT/CollectionRegistry/SBTRegistry.sol`

This is the last layer: you understand how the protocol **talks to the outside world** and how SBT features fit in.
