# Transfer

The Transfer function allows users to move crypto assets from one address or contract (e.g., a Garden) to another. It is the most fundamental blockchain operation and is essential for asset management across wallets, contracts, or users.

In the context of our platform, transfers can occur:

- From a userâ€™s wallet to a Garden
- Between different Gardens owned by the same user
- From a Garden to an external wallet or another user
