We see a future where holders of Cryptoassets will want to connect and engage with asset managers to grow their wealth without having to release custody of their funds to anyone. Our BLOK Capital DAO will ensure that not only will this be possible, but it will be transparent and cut out all the middle men, thereby reducing unnecessary fees and leave the Investor in total control and ownership with complete visibility of their wealth each second or as they wish.

Specifically, we shall develop and govern a blockchain protocol that enables decentralized wealth management for all classes of society, to reduce the wealth gap and drive financial inclusion.
