![System Overview](/img/Frame%2021.jpg)

## **1. System Overview**

This repository implements an **on‑chain asset management protocol** built around a **Diamond (EIP‑2535) controller** called the **Garden**.

High Level:

- Users and external systems interact with **one contract**: `src/garden/Garden.sol`.
- The Garden itself is **thin**: it doesn’t implement business logic directly.Instead it **routes calls** to a set of **facets** (modules) that implement:
  1. Core protocol mechanics (ownership, upgrades, introspection).
  2. Index‑related features (connecting to, tracking, and rebalancing indices).
  3. DeFi integrations (DEX swaps, GMX positions, Chainlink pricing).
- The **domain layer** (indices, registries, math) lives outside the Diamond and can be understood separately from the routing and storage mechanics.

### **Why Diamond?**

This protocol is designed to:

- **Evolve over time** (add/remove/upgrade features without migrating state).
- **Compose multiple domains** (indices, DEXs, GMX, SBTs) behind one address.
- **Expose a stable surface** while allowing internal modules to change.

The Diamond pattern gives you:

- A single address (`Garden.sol`) with:
  - A **facet registry**: has the information about which function selector is implemented by which facet.
  - **Shared storage**: state is centralized in a few well‑defined layouts.
  - **Upgradability**: base upgrade facet controls which facets are active.

Conceptually, think of the system as:

1. **Entrypoint (Garden)** → receives calls.
2. **Core Facets** → handle ownership, upgrades, introspection.
3. **Feature Facets** → index logic and DeFi integrations.
4. **Domain Layer** → indices, registries, strategies, math.
5. **Infrastructure** → LibDiamond, storage libs, OpenZeppelin.
6. **External Integrations** → DEXes, GMX, Chainlink, SBTs.

The diagram provided above is the authoritative map for these layers; this documentation follows that structure.
