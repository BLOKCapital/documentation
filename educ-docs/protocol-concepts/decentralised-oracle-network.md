### How does Blok Capital manages the atomic asynchronous transaction?

### 1). Contract Layer (Signal Emission):

- Here the contracts which are deployed mainly do 3 things which are

1. Manage your garden state.
2. Hold your crypto assets, tokens in your wallet.
3. Broadcast the events when something noticible activity happens (Eg. When a particiular Garden registers to DeFi Index).

This layer is basically a gatekeeper which hold your assets and allow changes when they receive the verified changes.

### 2). CRE Layer(Chainlink Runtime Environment):

- This Layer gets divided into 3 parts:

1. **Feeders**: Feeders collect the information from various sources such as the monitoring the blockchain watching the events from the garden, track market prices.
2. **Trigger layer (Batch Processing)**: Trigger layer standardizes all the data into a common format which the DON(Decentralised Oracle Network) can understand and process.
3. [\*\*DON](https://docs.chain.link/cre) (Decentralised Oracle Network)\*\*: This is the layer where all the execution takes place.

   → **Computation** executes the custom workflows. Different operations needs different logic so there are different workflows for the different operations.

   (E.g.: Rebalancing the porfolio needs to fetch the index prices.)

   → **_Validation_** performs security checks before any workflow executes.

   → **Consensus** aggregates the Results from the multiple DON network. Since each nodes runs the same workflow with same inputs they all should get same answer. These results are compared cryptographically.

   →We use the public DON, BLOK Capital does not control the computation layer since multiple nodes accross world controls it. So the results of the computation cannot be faked.

### 3). Contract Layer (Execution):

After the computation and consensus, the outputs return to the blockchain with the cryptographic proof that multiple DON nodes agreed. After the verification of the DON signature, the operations are executed.
