## **2. Entry Point: The Diamond Controller (`Garden.sol`)**

**File:**

`src/garden/Garden.sol`

This is the **main controller contract** and the **only contract address** that end‑users and most integrations should interact with.

### **What `Garden.sol` is**

- A **Diamond proxy**:
  - It owns the **facet registry** (via `LibDiamond` (Library diamond) and related storage).
  - It does not define business logic itself.
  - It forwards calls, based on `msg.sig`, to the correct facet using `delegatecall`.
- A **stable API surface**:
  - Even as facets are upgraded, users keep calling the same address.

### **What happens in the constructor**

Without quoting code, the constructor typically:

- **Initializes Diamond storage** via `LibDiamond`:
  - Sets the **contract owner** (for administration).
  - Registers the **initial facets** and their selectors (base facets at minimum).

- May **run an initial “diamond cut”**:
  - Add ownership, loupe, and cut/upgrade facets.
  - Optionally register early feature facets (index, utility).

The end result: once deployed, `Garden.sol` knows which functions exist and which facet implements each one, but it does **not** **hard‑code** that mapping.

### **What the Diamond does and does not do**

**Does:**

- Routes functions to facets via `delegatecall`.
- Maintains the **core routing data structures** in Diamond storage.
- Provides a single, consistent interface endpoint for all protocol features.

**Does not:**

- Implement feature logic like “rebalance index”, “swap on Uniswap”, or “open GMX position” directly.
- Directly own the business logic contracts such as `Index.sol` and registries – those are part of the domain layer and are called from facets.

### **Call routing**

When you call `Garden`:

1. The call hits `Garden.sol`.
2. The Diamond looks up `msg.sig` in its internal **selector → facet address** mapping (maintained by `LibDiamond` and diamond cut storage).
3. It issues a `delegatecall` into the facet:
   - Code runs in the context of the Garden.
   - Storage accessed is **Garden’s storage**, not the facet’s.
4. The result is returned to the caller as if the Garden implemented the function directly.

For a builder, this means:

- When you see a function in a facet like `IndexBase.connectToIndex`, it is actually **executed in Garden storage**.
- All stateful logic must use the **right storage layout libraries**.
