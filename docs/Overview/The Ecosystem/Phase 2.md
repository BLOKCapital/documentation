### Phase 2- Attract More Wealth Managers and Investors

We shall start attracting more Wealth Managers onto the platform along with Investors through a marketing phase whilst continuing to add more features to the platform, all proposed and decided upon by the Community. This phase will ensure our platform is even more efficient on gas fees (the fee required to successfully conduct a transaction, such as a swap, or the execution a contract on the blockchain).Â 

Fees are priced as a small percentage of swap fees to ensure scalable growth. All functional improvements shall be managed and implemented by the community, who will now also be users of the protocol and will be best placed to propose functional requirements they believe are required to continue to keep the protocol at the forefront of Investment Management on the blockchain to launch BLOK Capital V2.
