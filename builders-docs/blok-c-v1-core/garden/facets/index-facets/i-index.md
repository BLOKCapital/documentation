# `IIndex.sol`

This interface defines the essential data structures passed between the off-chain Centralized Relayer Engine (CRE) and the on-chain protocol.

## Core Concept: Swap Instructions & Intents

To execute a rebalance, the CRE must provide an array of `SwapStep` instructions. The protocol compares the outcome of these steps against the locked `PendingIntent`.

## Crucial Builder Snippet: The Execution Types

```solidity
/// @notice A single swap step provided by the CRE to rebalance the garden.
struct SwapStep {
    bytes32 dexId; // Resolved to a selector on-chain (e.g., keccak256("UNISWAP_V3"))
    SwapInstruction instruction; // Contains tokens, pools, and amounts
}

/// @notice Pending rebalance intent data (slimmed for gas efficiency)
struct PendingIntent {
    bool active;
    uint256 totalValueUsd; // Portfolio value at intent creation
    bytes32[] symbols;
    uint256[] targetValues; // Desired USD value per token
}
```
