# Token Design

At BLOK Capital, our token transcends mere functionality—it embodies our commitment to decentralized wealth management and community-driven governance.

## Design Philosophy

The BLOK token is a tangible representation of our dual commitment

- **Front**: Features the bold BLOK monogram, symbolizing clarity, strength, and our institutional-grade infrastructure.
- **Back**: Showcases the Owl of Wisdom encircled by our governance credo: *"In Gardens We Trust"*, reflecting our dedication to wisdom, transparency, and community stewardship.

This duality mirrors our ethos of combining robust financial frameworks with user-centric experiences.

## Token Visuals
