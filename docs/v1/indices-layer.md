## **Indices Layer (Domain & Business Logic)**

**Location:** `src/indices/`

**Key components:**

- `Index.sol`: Core index contract managing components and weights.
- `IndexFactory.sol`: Factory for deploying Index instances.
- `IndexComponentRegistry.sol`: Whitelist of approved tokens.
- `IndexCalculationRegistry.sol`: Whitelist of approved calculation strategies.
- `CirculatingSupply.sol`: Off-chain data oracle for token supply.
- `IndexMath.sol`: Library for weight and value calculations.

### **Index Entity**

An `Index` is the **on-chain representation of a portfolio composition**. It intentionally doesn't execute trades; it just defines the **what** (composition). The **how** (execution) is handled by the Garden's IndexFacet.

### **Index Factory**

- **Creates new indices** with validated components.
- **Enforces constraints**: Max 250 components per index.
- **Tracks metadata**: Name, ID, deployment time, calculation strategy used.

### **Governance Registries**

- **Component Registry**: Governance controls which tokens and price feeds are "safe" to use.
- **Calculation Registry**: DAO controls which math implementations (e.g., market cap weighted, equal weighted) are approved.

### **Index Math Library**

Provides pure logic for:

- **Weight calculation**: Given prices and supplies, compute target weights.
- **Portfolio value**: Calculate total value in USD.
- **Rebalance amounts**: Determine how much of each token to buy/sell.

### **Circulating Supply Oracle**

An off-chain bridge for token supply data. Authorized updaters push latest supply data on-chain, which facets query for market-cap-based calculations.
