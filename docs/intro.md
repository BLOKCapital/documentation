# What is BLOK Capital?

**BLOK Capital** is a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** built on **Arbitrum**, a scalable Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain. It connects **Investors** and **Wealth Managers** through smart contracts, enabling decentralized, transparent, and secure wealth management.

---

## Investor Custody & Control

Unlike traditional models where investors hand over control of their assets to a fund, BLOK Capital ensures:

* Investors always retain custody of their assets.
* Assets stay in the investor’s wallet at all times.
* Wealth Managers never gain full control or withdrawal rights over the assets.

---

## Smart Contract-Driven Agreements

All investor-manager relationships are governed by smart contracts:

* Define tenure, fees, and exit conditions.
* Grant Wealth Managers **limited access** to manage or trade assets.
* Restrict unauthorized transfers outside the investor’s wallet.
* Allow either party to end the contract at any time, giving the investor full control and flexibility.

---

## The Garden Analogy

BLOK Capital reimagines wealth management:

* The **Investor** is like a **Garden Owner**: full visibility and control.
* The **Wealth Manager** is like a **Gardener**: given permission to tend and grow the assets (the “Garden”).
* Access continues only as long as the investor is satisfied with the manager’s performance.

---

## Why It Matters

This approach:

* Eliminates intermediaries.
* Establishes a transparent, peer-to-peer investment model.
* Promotes financial inclusion by democratizing access to wealth management tools.

---

## A DAO for Financial Inclusion

BLOK Capital is more than a protocol—it’s a movement:

* Built and governed by its community.
* Aims to **bridge the wealth gap** and expand access to crypto asset management for all.
