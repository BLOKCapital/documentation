# User Journey 

In this section, the user interaction flow at BLOK Capital is examined, highlighting its frictionless onboarding and portfolio management processes. Through a streamlined Gmail-based authentication, a self‑custodial smart‑contract wallet is provided without burdening the user with private keys or seed phrases, all gas fees are sponsored by the DAO.

### Onboarding & Account Creation
**Enter Gmail address**
 - The user visits BLOK Capital and submits their e‑mail (Gmail) address.
  
**Create account**
 - BLOK Capital provisions a new account for the user, tied to that address.

**Self‑custodial Smart Wallet**
 - Simultaneously, the platform instantiates a non‑custodial, “gasless” smart‑contract wallet on the blockchain for the user (so they can transact without worrying about paying gas directly).

### Garden Initialization
**Create Garden**
 - From within their new account and wallet, the user elects to “create a Garden.”

**Minting the Garden‑NFT**
 - The system mints a unique NFT that represents legal ownership of that Garden. This NFT sits in the user’s smart wallet as proof of their portfolio.


### Funding & Managing the Garden (v1: “Manage Yourself”)
**Fund your Garden**
 - The user deposits supported crypto assets (ETH, stablecoins, tokens, etc.) into their Garden.
**Self‑management**
 - They may then perform on‑chain operations—swap, transfer, lend, borrow, etc.—directly from within their Garden, exercising full control over their strategy.


### Optional Portfolio Automation Paths (coming soon...)
**v2: Connect with BLOK Capital Indexes**
 - The user can opt to link their Garden to one or more of BLOK Capital’s curated index products. Once connected, the Garden will automatically rebalance and track the index.

**v3: Connect with Gardeners (Wealth Managers)**
 - Alternatively, or in addition, the user can select from top professional “gardeners” (wealth‑management partners) on the platform.
