# Decentralized Wealth Management

**Decentralized Wealth Management** refers to the use of blockchain technology and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) protocols to manage assets and investments without reliance on traditional intermediaries such as banks, financial advisors, or centralized wealth management firms.

Rather than being controlled by centralized entities, investors interact directly with smart contracts, the BLOK Capital DAO, and non-custodial smart wallets—giving them full self-custody over their assets.

## Wealth Managers, Reimagined

In this decentralized model, investors can connect directly with Wealth Managers via smart contracts. These smart contracts enable wealth managers to strategically manage investor portfolios—but without ever taking custody or having withdrawal rights. This architecture:

* Ensures complete investor control
* Prevents unauthorized asset access
* Enables trustless collaboration

All wealth manager actions and performance metrics are transparently recorded on-chain, providing investors with verifiable, real time insights into performance. This system brings a new level of accountability, transparency, and trust to wealth management.
