To make the BLOK Capital project benefit from existing functionality that already exists on the blockchain, we will integrate with the following Service DAOs so as not to reinvent the wheel and where the costs to do so are cost effective. This will reduce the time needed for development of Phase 1 and therefore allow us to launch faster. The Service DAOs we have selected to integrate with are:
  
- **Uniswap** : We will integrate multiple Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) for the future but will first integrate with UniSwap as a first measure to handle our trading requirements. In the future we will make requests to all DEXs simultaneously to decide which DEX we would choose to make the trade on. This would be another benefit users would get by using our Investment Management Platform.
- **Streamflow.Finance** : on-chain tokenomics and payroll protocol has been selected to manage payment of any DAO worker deemed fit by the community. They will also provide project contributors with a dashboard of the tokenomics independently showing the token vesting and locks to provide full transparency and confidence to token owners.
- **Gnosis**: the most trusted platform to manage digital assets EVM Multi-chain. To manage our DAO Treasury multiple team members will confirm every transaction in order to execute it using the Gnosis Multisig Vault.
