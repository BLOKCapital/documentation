The aim of BLOK Capital is to enable financial inclusivity by enabling all walks of life to have access to the services of expert wealth managers but, at the same time, always have custody of their funds.

It is clear following the demise of exchanges like FTX that we need more protocols that run on the blockchain as a DAO. In this way investors can be sure their funds are not being managed in any way by a centralized authority or CeFi.

Furthermore it is vital that the custody of the investors funds or wealth is always with the investor themselves.

The BLOK Capital platform ensures both the above two points are operational, furthermore allows for a new paradigm with the option for wealth managers to be able to manage money on behalf of investors in the way gardeners manage gardens for garden owners. We believe as the interest in Crypto asset Investing continues to rise, the BLOK Capital protocol will see exponential growth in its use.
