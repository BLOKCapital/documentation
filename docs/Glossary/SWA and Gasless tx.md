# SWA and Gasless tx

A Smart Contract Wallet (SWA) is an advanced type of blockchain wallet powered by programmable smart contracts. Unlike traditional wallets that rely solely on private keys to manage assets, SWAs offer enhanced functionality, automation, and security by executing logic directly on the blockchain.

On our platform, every user is provided with an SWA, which serves as their primary interface for interacting with the ecosystem. These wallets enable:

- Gasless transactions, where the platform abstracts away gas fees or subsidizes them
- Seamless interactions with smart contracts, including swaps, lending, and transfers
- Programmable permissions and access controls for advanced use cases

By integrating SWAs, we ensure that users experience a more intuitive, secure, and flexible way to manage their crypto assets without needing to understand the technical complexities of blockchain operations.
