# Builders Section

The Builders Section is designed for developers and technical contributors who want to dive deep into the architecture, smart contracts, and governance logic of the Blok Capital ecosystem. This section covers core components like the Blok Capital V1 protocol, contract structures, DAO governance mechanisms, and advanced testing/debugging workflows. It provides the technical foundation and implementation details necessary to build, audit, or extend the protocol with confidence.
