## 1. Sign in and create your smart wallet

- Sign in with Google.
- Create your smart wallet account (SWA). This is the account that will hold your assets and interact with the protocol.
- The SWA is monitored for health, balances, approvals, and activity. If needed, the system can show alerts and analytics for the SWA.

## 2. Referral code and pass minting

- You may enter an optional referral code during onboarding. Referral codes are provided by the protocol only (for example, “builder” referral for Builders).
- Based on your referral and role, the protocol mints a soulbound pass (SBT). Examples:
  - Builder Pass
  - Baddie Pass
  - Angel Pass
- Passes are non-transferable and act as access tokens for creating certain kinds of gardens.
- Each pass is valid for one garden. If you have two passes (for example one Builder and one Baddie), you can create two gardens (one per pass).

## 3. Choose garden collection and create your garden

- When you create a garden, you choose which collection it belongs to. The protocol controls the available collections.
- To create a garden in a collection, you must hold the matching pass. The app guides you and shows which collections you can access based on your pass.
- If you hold multiple passes (for example, both Builder and Quant), you can create multiple gardens one for each pass you own.

## 4. Fund your garden

- Deposit funds into your garden from your SWA.
- Deposit happens first. Only after funding do you connect a strategy or choose manual mode.

Supported assets depend on network and protocol settings. The app shows supported assets and balances.

## 5. Pick how you want to manage the garden

You can manage the garden in one of these ways:

- Index garden (automatic)
  - Connect to an Index strategy for auto-rebalancing.
  - The garden adjusts holdings to match the index weights automatically.
  - Swaps are routed through supported DEXs (for example, Uniswap V3), and WETH is used as the base where it helps routing.
- Self-managed garden (manual)
  - You choose the assets and manage trades yourself.
  - No automatic rebalancing.

Notes:

- Some gardens are specifically designed for Index strategies (auto rebalancing).
- Some gardens are normal self-managed gardens.
- The app will clearly label which type you are creating or using.

## 6. Connect the strategy or choose manual mode

- After you deposit funds, set how the garden operates.
- For Index gardens:
  - Connect to the chosen Index.
  - The garden reads target weights from the Index and rebalances automatically.
- For self-managed gardens:
  - Select “Self-managed” (manual mode).
  - You decide the assets and place trades yourself.
  - There is no automatic rebalancing.

Important:

- Deposit funds first, then either connect an Index or choose Self-managed mode.
- Only Index gardens auto rebalance. Self-managed gardens do not.

## 7. DAO and voting

- There is a DAO tab where voting happens.
- Voting power is based on the amount of BLOKC you hold.
- Use the DAO tab to join votes, view proposals, and see results.

## 8. Analytics

- The app shows analytics for your garden and your account:
  - Portfolio value and P&L
  - Asset allocation and rebalancing history
  - Swaps and fees
  - Risk and approvals
- SWA analytics are also shown so you can track the health and activity of your smart wallet.
