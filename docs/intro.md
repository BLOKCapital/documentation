# Introduction

BLOK Capital is a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) to be built and minted on the Ethereum scalable Layer 2 Blockchain called, Arbitrum for Investors and Wealth Managers to connect and work together. Unlike the traditional method of investing, where the Investor has to send their assets to a fund for management by an Wealth Manager, with BLOK Capital, Investors are always in direct control of their blockchain assets, as they are always held directly in their own corresponding wallets, and so never have to release them at any time to a 3rd party.

This arrangement can be managed because Wealth Managers will only be given access to the Investors’ wallets once terms between the two have been agreed through a blockchain-supported smart contract. The ensuing contract would determine tenure and management fees along with early exit costs.
 
Once the smart contract is established, the Wealth Manager will be given access to the Investors’ assets, granting them the ability to swap or trade assets within the Investors’ Wallets. It is important to note that by using smart contracts, a Wealth Manager is prevented from transferring an Investors’ blockchain assets outside of the Investors’ Wallets. An additional important feature of a smart contract based investment arrangement is that the relationship can be ended at any point by either party for whatever reason, giving the Investor total and immediate control of their assets.These are the fundamental principles of how BLOK Capital works, ensuring that Investors are always in full custody of their assets with full visibility at all times, including the ability to choose specific Wealth Manager(s) to have access to their wallets and assets to trade and grow their wealth.

We believe the unique features of BLOK Capital are the future of the  Investor / Wealth Manager relationship. We view this arrangement analogous to the relationship a Garden Owner has with their Gardener. That the Garden is always in full visibility, ownership and control to the Garden Owner and that they are given the pleasure of seeing their Garden everyday. That the Gardener is given the key to the Garden gate to be able to prune and feed the plants and trees to aid perfect growth of the Garden. Depending on the progress of a Gardener the Garden Owner will decide whether access to the Garden gate will continue day on day.

This completely new approach will revolutionise Cryptoasset Investment Management by using Blockchain technology and smart contracts. As one would expect from a Blockchain Protocol:
- this will remove any middle men between the relationship of Investor and Wealth Manager
- the protocol will be a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

Together, we shall build and govern a blockchain protocol that enables decentralized wealth management for all classes of society, to reduce the wealth gap and drive financial inclusion.
