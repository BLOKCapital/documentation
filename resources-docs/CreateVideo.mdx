### Understanding the Project Structure

Before contributing, it’s helpful to understand how the documentation is organized:

- Each **folder** in the `/docs` directory represents a major section of the documentation.
- Each **file** within those folders is a subsection or content page.
- All files are written in **Markdown** (`.md`) format.

---

### Types of Contributions

You can contribute to the documentation in the following ways:

- **Updating an existing section or subsection**  
  Add new information, fix errors, correct outdated content, or remove irrelevant material.

- **Adding a new subsection**  
  Create a new content page under an existing section.

- **Creating a new section**  
  Introduce an entirely new section to the documentation by adding a new folder.

---

### How to Contribute

#### 1. Updating an Existing Section or Subsection

- Identify the section or file you want to update.
- Open the corresponding `.md` file.
- Make your edits directly—additions, deletions, or corrections as needed.

#### 2. Adding a New Subsection

- Locate the relevant section folder.
- Create a new file with a `.md` extension (e.g., `new-subsection.md`).
- Add your content in Markdown format.

#### 3. Adding a New Section

- Create a new folder under the `/docs` directory with an appropriate name.
- Inside that folder, create a new `.md` file for your content.
- Your new section and its content will now be recognized by the documentation system.
