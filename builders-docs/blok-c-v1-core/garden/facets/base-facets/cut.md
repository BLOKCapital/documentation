# Cut

This module manages state upgrades within the Diamond but enforces Blok Capital's strict "Registry-First" security model.

## `DiamondCutBase.sol`

This is the internal engine for all upgrades. Unlike standard Diamonds that accept arbitrary facet addresses, Blok Capital's `DiamondCutBase` forces every upgrade to be validated against the global `FacetRegistry`.

**Key Builder Takeaway:** A Garden cannot add a facet unless it is globally whitelisted and its module is explicitly allowed for that specific Garden Type.

**Crucial Snippet: Registry Security Check**

```solidity
// From addFunctions() in DiamondCutBase.sol
// Ensure facet's module is allowed for this garden's type
bytes32 gardenType = ld.gardenType;
if (gardenType != bytes32(0)) {
    bytes32 moduleId = IFacetRegistry(facetRegistry).getFacetModule(_facetAddress);
    if (!IFacetRegistry(facetRegistry).isModuleAllowedForGardenType(gardenType, moduleId)) {
        revert DiamondCut_ModuleNotAllowedForGardenType(gardenType, moduleId);
    }
}
```

## `DiamondCutFacet.sol` (The Shield)

In a standard EIP-2535 implementation, the `diamondCut` function is callable by the owner to upgrade the contract. **In Blok Capital, this function is intentionally blocked.** This facet is included to satisfy the interface requirements of EIP-2535, but it forces all actual upgrades to go through a custom, highly controlled upgrade flow (likely via an `UpgradeFacet` not shown here) to prevent ambiguity and human error.

**Crucial Snippet: The Intentional Revert**

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IDiamondCut
function diamondCut(
    FacetCut[] memory _diamondCut,
    address _init,
    bytes calldata _calldata
)
    external
    override
    onlyGardenOwner
    ifIndexNotConnected
{
    // Blocked intentionally to force controlled upgrade paths
    revert DiamondCutFacet_DiamondCutNotAllowed();
}
```

## `DiamondCutStorage.sol`

Defines the standard EIP-2535 storage layout required to track facet addresses and their associated function selectors.

- **Storage Pattern:** Uses `LibStorageSlot.deriveStorageSlot(type(DiamondCutStorage).name)` to guarantee the storage layout never collides with other facets.
